    title: 'Opening Doors: 30+ Free Coaching Calls for Aspiring AI Professionals',
    emoji: 'ü§ù',
    summary: 'Over 30 free 15‚Äëminute coaching calls for students and fresh grads worldwide‚Äîfocused, practical guidance without paywalls.',
    tags: ['Career','Mentorship','Coaching','Community','AI','Education'],
    metrics: { calls: '30+', duration: '15 min', cadence: 'Mon/Fri' },
    content: `
      <p>Six months ago, after many messages asking for career advice from my path through Apple, TikTok, Meta, Uber, and McKinsey, I realized individual replies weren‚Äôt scalable. The solution was simple: open my calendar and offer free 15‚Äëminute coaching slots on Monday and Friday mornings and evenings (GMT).</p>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>Capable candidates‚Äîespecially from underrepresented socioeconomic backgrounds‚Äîoften lack informal networks and actionable guidance. Paid ‚ÄúAI coaching‚Äù services are expensive and frequently low‚Äëquality.</p>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>I ran free, bookable coaching calls (15 minutes each) for students and recent graduates worldwide, prioritizing those without access to established networks.</p>

      <h3>What We Covered</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CV diagnostics</strong>: why applications stall and immediate fixes</li>
        <li><strong>Role navigation</strong>: ML Engineer vs Data Scientist vs Research Scientist</li>
        <li><strong>Project prioritization</strong>: which projects to highlight for target roles</li>
        <li><strong>Interview preparation</strong>: patterns unique to ML/DS interviews</li>
        <li><strong>Academia vs industry</strong>: trade‚Äëoffs and long‚Äëterm implications</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Over <strong>30 coaching calls</strong> delivered</li>
        <li>Participants reported <strong>interviews</strong> and <strong>job offers</strong> following CV and positioning changes</li>
        <li>Confidence gains‚Äîclearer roadmaps and next steps</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Free Matters</h3>
      <p>I took a clear stance against paywalled advice. Career guidance should not be a luxury good; those who need it most can rarely afford it.</p>

      <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
      <p>While I can‚Äôt sustain this intensity indefinitely, the recurring patterns now inform broader, open resources and guides tackling the most common challenges.</p>

      <h3>Call to Peers</h3>
      <p>If you‚Äôre in a senior role, consider opening even a small portion of your calendar for free coaching. A few hours per month across our field could meaningfully diversify who gets in‚Äîand who thrives.</p>

    title: 'Adaptive Entropy‚ÄëGated Contrastive Fusion (AECF): Robust, Calibrated Multimodal Inference with Missing Inputs',
    emoji: 'üß©',
    summary: 'AECF is a light‚Äëweight fusion layer that adapts entropy per instance, enforces monotone calibration across modality subsets, and yields big masked‚Äëinput gains with frozen backbones.',
    tags: ['Multimodal','Fusion','Calibration','Robustness','Entropy','Contrastive','AECF'],
    metrics: { datasets: 'AV‚ÄëMNIST, MS‚ÄëCOCO', ece: '‚Üì up to 2√ó', overhead: '<1%' },
    content: `
      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>Real‚Äëworld multimodal systems routinely face missing‚Äëinput scenarios (e.g., a robot loses audio; a clinical record omits labs at inference). Standard fusion layers typically preserve either <em>robustness</em> or <em>calibration</em>‚Äîbut rarely both.</p>

      <h3>Solution: AECF</h3>
      <p><strong>Adaptive Entropy‚ÄëGated Contrastive Fusion (AECF)</strong> is a single, light‚Äëweight layer that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(i) adapts its entropy coefficient <em>per instance</em>,</li>
        <li>(ii) enforces <strong>monotone calibration</strong> across all modality subsets, and</li>
        <li>(iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from <em>training‚Äëtime entropy</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>On <strong>AV‚ÄëMNIST</strong> and <strong>MS‚ÄëCOCO</strong>, AECF improves masked‚Äëinput <strong>mAP by +18 pp</strong> at a <strong>50% drop</strong> rate,</li>
        <li>while reducing <strong>ECE</strong> by up to <strong>2&times;</strong>,</li>
        <li>with &lt;1% runtime overhead.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Compatibility</h3>
      <p>All backbones remain <em>frozen</em>, making AECF an easy drop‚Äëin layer for robust, calibrated multimodal inference under missing inputs.</p>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>We analyze per‚Äësubset calibration guarantees and show instance‚Äëwise entropy gating yields both resilience to missing modalities and improved uncertainty estimates.</p>

      <p>After a lot of money wasted on API calls, I am proud to announce our new preprint: <strong>LLMs are BAYESIAN (in Expectation, not Realisation)</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Transformers are Bayesian ‚Äî but only on average.</strong> They can violate martingale rules (prompt token exchangeability) by design. We prove the gap shrinks as log(n)/n, and in expectation, models hit near‚Äëoptimal risk (n^-1/2). Practical tip: average predictions over shuffled prompts to reduce variance without retraining.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut chain‚Äëof‚Äëthought tokens, cut costs.</strong> Our closed‚Äëform result shows optimal CoT length grows only with sqrt(n), not linearly. Many users overspend on tokens by 80‚Äì90%. Shorter, principled chains retain performance efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>G&ouml;del, incompleteness, and why CoT is essential.</strong> No finite transformer computes everything internally; with an <em>external</em> chain‚Äëof‚Äëthought sized to task complexity, anything computable becomes reachable. CoT prompting is a fundamental ingredient for next‚Äëgen LLMs.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
      <p>Huge thanks to the team helping with empirical validation and coding: Zein Khamis, Sarah Rashidi. Grateful to Mark Antonio and Moustapha Awada, Ph.D., for collaborating on LLM theory and checking the many proofs.</p>

      <h3>Call for Feedback</h3>
      <p>Would love feedback from others working at the theory‚Äëpractice boundary. Please read the preprint and share thoughts.</p>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>Students from non‚Äëtraditional backgrounds often feel shut out of AI. They lack a clear path to showcase strengths, earn internships, and translate academic work into industry‚Äëready impact.</p>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>A practical, strategy‚Äëfirst seminar bridging academia and industry. We tailored guidance to stages from first‚Äëyear exploration to final‚Äëyear job searches, with concrete steps and examples.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Competitive internships secured</strong> at startups and established companies</li>
        <li><strong>Successful transitions</strong> into AI roles from non‚ÄëCS disciplines</li>
        <li><strong>Confidence and clarity</strong>‚Äîstudents left with realistic roadmaps</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Topics We Explored</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leveraging academic projects</strong>: turn coursework/research into portfolio pieces</li>
        <li><strong>The internship strategy</strong>: target roles aligned to goals; stand‚Äëout applications</li>
        <li><strong>Building while studying</strong>: contribute to open source alongside coursework</li>
        <li><strong>The non‚Äëlinear path</strong>: realistic timelines for non‚ÄëCS backgrounds</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Breaking Down Barriers</h3>
      <p>We addressed imposter syndrome head‚Äëon, showing how diverse perspectives‚Äîethics, linguistics, psychology, economics‚Äîare strengths that the AI field needs.</p>

      <h3>The Academic Advantage</h3>
      <p>University access to research, networks, compute, and freedom to experiment is a real advantage. We focused on how to leverage it effectively.</p>

      <h3>Resources That Keep Giving</h3>
      <p>All materials remain freely available online and are designed to complement studies‚Äîtemplates, project ideas, and step‚Äëby‚Äëstep guides.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>The next generation of AI innovators won‚Äôt come from CS alone‚Äîthey‚Äôll emerge from philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and beyond. Many students who doubted their place in AI left with internships, roles, and renewed confidence.</p>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>LLMs can produce confident but incorrect outputs (hallucinations), making them risky in settings where factual accuracy is required.</p>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>We trained models and tooling to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚úÖ Provide <strong>evidence-grounded answers</strong> with explicit citations</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Express <strong>calibrated confidence levels</strong> (0‚Äì1 scale)</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Know when to say <em>‚ÄúI don't know‚Äù</em> when evidence is insufficient</li>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>üìà <strong>54% improvement</strong> in accuracy (80.5% exact match vs 52.3% baseline)</li>
        <li>üéØ <strong>0% hallucination rate</strong> through calibrated refusal</li>
        <li>üîç <strong>82% citation correctness</strong> (models show their work)</li>
        <li>üõ°Ô∏è <strong>24% refusal rate</strong> when evidence is lacking (better safe than sorry!)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p><strong>What Makes This Different:</strong> Instead of hiding uncertainty in fluent prose, we enforce <strong>structured JSON outputs</strong> that create accountability. When the model isn't sure, it explicitly refuses rather than making things up.</p>

      <p><strong>Interesting Finding:</strong> Under noisy/cluttered contexts, the model maintains answer quality but sometimes cites the wrong sources‚Äîidentifying the next challenge to solve!</p>

      <h4>Open Resources</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>‚Ä¢ Training code & configs</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ 1,198 preference pairs for reproduction</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ DeBERTa reward model (97.4% accuracy)</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ Complete evaluation framework</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This work represents a practical step toward AI systems that are not just powerful, but genuinely <strong>trustworthy</strong> for real-world applications where factual accuracy is non‚Äënegotiable.</p>

      <p><strong>What strategies is your team using to improve AI reliability?</strong> Would love to hear about different approaches to this critical challenge!</p>
